Our packet sniffer captures ethernet frames and displays the destination and source MAC addresses and the protocol being used.

Usage:

```
$ time python3 packet_sniffer.py
```

Output:

```
Ethernet Frame: 
Destination: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, Source: 24:A4:3C:30:36:2B, Protocol: 1544

Ethernet Frame: 
Destination: AC:72:89:93:47:C0, Source: 00:15:5D:00:24:0E, Protocol: 8

```
